# PacMan-Search-Algorithms
This repository explores the behavior and performance of different search algorithms using the classic Pacman project from UC Berkeleyâ€™s AI course. By running Pacman through a variety of mazes, I compare how algorithms like DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* (with different heuristics) solve pathfinding problems of increasing complexity.

The repo demonstrates these concepts through hands-on experiments, where Pacman navigates mazes of different sizes and structures using a variety of agents and strategies.

Some example commands include:

- Running Pacman in test and tiny mazes with simple agents

- Applying BFS, UCS, and A* search to medium and large mazes

- Solving more advanced problems like **CornersProblem** and **FoodSearch**

- Comparing specialized agents like **StayEastSearchAgent**, **StayWestSearchAgent**, and **ApproximateSearchAgent**

âš¡ Requirements: This project requires **Python 2**.

ðŸ“‚ Usage: All example commands are listed in commands.txt.

This project is a practical way to visualize how different search strategies impact efficiency, path length, and problem-solving in AI.
